# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## API usage

### TMDB

Courtesy to the team at [https://developer.themoviedb.org/](TMDB) for the free tier usage and ease to understand documentation, the app performs a `GET` request to the API to fetch the top rated movies, a `GET` request to fetch a movie detail page and lastly, another `GET` request to make a simple search of [https://themoviedb.org/](TMDB) database.
